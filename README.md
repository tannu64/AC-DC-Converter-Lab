# AC-DC Converter: Rectifiers and Voltage Regulators

This repository contains documentation and implementation details for Experiment 4: Rectifiers and Voltage Regulators, focusing on AC to DC conversion.

## Objectives

- Explore rectification and voltage regulation applications of diodes
- Understand filtering and voltage regulation in AC to DC conversion
- Learn practical design techniques for simple AC to DC conversion systems

## Components Used

- Center-tapped transformer
- Silicon diodes (1N4001 rectifier diodes)
- Zener diode
- Electrolytic capacitors (10μF, 470μF)
- Resistors (4.7kΩ, 270Ω)
- Connecting wires and bridging plugs

## Experiment Overview

The experiment demonstrates the conversion of AC to DC power through:
1. **Rectification** - Converting AC to pulsating DC using diodes
2. **Filtering** - Reducing ripple with capacitors
3. **Voltage Regulation** - Maintaining stable output voltage with a Zener diode

## Key Findings

- Full-wave rectification doubles the frequency (60Hz → 120Hz)
- Filtering significantly reduces peak-to-peak ripple voltage
- Voltage regulators effectively maintain stable output despite load changes
- Larger filter capacitance reduces output ripple
- Lower load resistance increases ripple in unregulated circuits

## Circuit Diagrams

- Full-wave rectifier with center-tapped transformer
- Regulated DC power supply with filtering

## Applications

This AC to DC conversion system is fundamental for powering electronic equipment that requires stable DC voltage from standard AC power sources.
